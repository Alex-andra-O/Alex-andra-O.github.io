I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Science/Psychology (yes, that is the program name; yes, it relates to the discussion about whether it's "psychology" or "science") at Stony Brook University, located on Long Island, NY. 

Broadly speaking, I study "collective cognition" using behavioral and computational methods. I've investigated contagion mechanisms of (false) memories, simulated agents to investigate origins of domain differences in exploratory choice, and recently focused on social learning in complex decision-making tasks. 

I've "lived" in over 10 different cities across Europe and the US and am happy to share any insights I might have about the research landscape in both regions (and am more than happy to learn about and from other's insights too). If any undergrads stumble across this homepage: I'm also always happy to provide information about possible careers in- and outside of academia. 

For everyone interested in my research I recommend the "[Research](https://alex-andra-o.github.io/research/)" tab and please also always feel free to [contact](mailto:alexandra.ortmann@stonybrook.edu) me!
