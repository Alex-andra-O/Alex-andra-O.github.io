Hi and welcome to my homepage! I'm a PhD student in Cognitive Science/Psychology (yes, that is the program name; no, they couldn't make up their mind whether its "psychology" or "science") at Stony Brook University, located on Long Island, NY. 

Broadly speaking, I study "collective cognition" using behavioral and computational methods. I've investigated contagion mechanisms of (false) memories, simulated agents to investigate origins of domain differences in exploratory choice, and recently focused on social learning in complex decision-making tasks. 

I've lived in nine different cities across Europe and the US and am happy to share any insights I might have about research landscape in both regions (and am more than happy to learn other's insights too). If any undergrads stumble across this homepage: I'm also always happy to provide information about possible careers in- and outside of academia. 

For everyone interested in my research I recommend the "Research" tab and please also always feel free to contact me!
